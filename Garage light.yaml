  name: Motion and Door Activated Light with Auto-Off
  description: >-
    Turns on a light when a specified door is opened or motion is detected.
    The light will then turn off after a configurable amount of time with no motion,
    but only if the door is also closed. Includes an optional smart failsafe timer
    to turn the light off after it's been on for a long time while there is no motion.
